 <h2>What should we watch in Netflix<br> (for Korean user) </h2>
    <img src="web1.jpg" width="100%">

 <p>Many Korean people say "we pay money for Netflix to see <strong>the first page</strong> of them" </p>
 <p>It means we're struggling to choose one content that we might like.<br>So I'm gonna recommend some movies or series that I enjoyed very much</p>
 <p><h2><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888" target = "_blank">Black Mirror</a></h2></p>
 <p>If you are a big fan of the dystopian genre, you must watch this series.<br>
 It is about the future that is regad to the unanticipated consequences. </p>
 <p>*If you are not familiar with shocking content, you should skip the first episode of the first season. 
     This is because many people around me gave up after watching this episode.
